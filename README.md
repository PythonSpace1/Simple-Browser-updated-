# Simple-Browser-updated

Hello, this is my "Sunday I'm bored job I did" expect bugs etc but feel free to edit the code to your liking! it's not going to be perfect but thats coding lol.

In order for this to work you need to install https://electronjs.org/ and make sure you follow the guide to do it

Update!!! We now have a .EXE or .DMG for you lucky lot to install you can still install it via electron if you want but you can now run it without!

(for mac and windows command promt) mkdir ElectronBrowser && cd ElectronBrowser npm init -y npm install electron

(windows powershell) mkdir ElectronBrowser cd ElectronBrowser npm init -y npm install electron
